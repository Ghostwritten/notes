21. Set configuration context $ kubectl config use-context wk8s

A Kubernetes worker node, labelled with name=wk8s-node-0 is in state NotReady . Investigate why this is the case, and perform any appropriate steps to bring the node to a Ready state, ensuring that any changes are made permanent.

Hints:

You can ssh to the failed node using $ ssh wk8s-node-0
You can assume elevated privileges on the node with the following command $ sudo -i Question weight: 4%
第二十一题
22. Set configuration context $ kubectl config use-context wk8s

Configure the kubelet systemd managed service, on the node labelled with name=wk8s-node-1, to launch a Pod containing a single container of image nginx named myservice automatically. Any spec files required should be placed in the /etc/kubernetes/manifests directory on the node.

Hints:

You can ssh to the failed node using $ ssh wk8s-node-1
You can assume elevated privileges on the node with the following command $ sudo -i Question weight: 4%
第二十二题
23. Set configuration context $ kubectl config use-context ik8s

In this task, you will configure a new Node, `ik8s-node-0`, to join a Kubernetes cluster as follows:

Configure kubelet for automatic certificate rotation and ensure that both server and client CSRs are automatically approved and signed as appropnate via the use of `RBAC`.
Ensure that the appropriate cluster-info `ConfigMap` is created and configured appropriately in the correct namespace so that future Nodes can easily join the cluster
Your bootstrap kubeconfig should be created on the new Node at `/etc/kubernetes/bootstrap-kubelet.conf` (do not remove this file once your Node has successfully joined the cluster)
The appropriate cluster-wide `CA certificate` is located on the Node at `/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt` . You should ensure that any automatically issued certificates are installed to the node at `/var/lib/kubelet/pki` and that the kubeconfig file for kubelet will be rendered at `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet`.conf upon successful bootstrapping
Use an additional group for bootstrapping Nodes attempting to join the cluster which should be called `system:bootstrappers:cka:default-node-token`
Solution should start automatically on boot, with the systemd service unit file for kubelet available at `/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service`
To test your solution, create the appropriate resources from the spec file located at /opt/..../kube-flannel.yaml This will create the necessary supporting resources as well as the `kube-flannel -ds` DaemonSet . You should ensure that this DaemonSet is correctly deployed to the single node in the cluster.

Hints:

kubelet is not configured or running on ik8s-master-0 for this task, and you should not attempt to configure it.
You will make use of TLS bootstrapping to complete this task.
You can obtain the IP address of the Kubernetes API server via the following command $ ssh ik8s-node-0 getent hosts ik8s-master-0
The API server is listening on the usual port, 6443/tcp, and will only server TLS requests
The kubelet binary is already installed on ik8s-node-0 at /usr/bin/kubelet . You will not need to deploy kube-proxy to the cluster during this task.
You can ssh to the new worker node using $ ssh ik8s-node-0
You can ssh to the master node with the following command $ ssh ik8s-master-0
No further configuration of control plane services running on ik8s-master-0 is required
You can assume elevated privileges on both nodes with the following command $ sudo -i
Docker is already installed and running on ik8s-node-0

24. Set configuration context $ kubectl config use-context bk8s

Given a partially-functioning Kubenetes cluster, identify symptoms of failure on the cluster. Determine the node, the failing service and take actions to bring up the failed service and restore the health of the cluster. Ensure that any changes are made permanently.

The worker node in this cluster is labelled with name=bk8s-node-0 Hints:

You can ssh to the relevant nodes using $ ssh $(NODE) where $(NODE) is one of bk8s-master-0 or bk8s-node-0
You can assume elevated privileges on any node in the cluster with the following command$ sudo -i
